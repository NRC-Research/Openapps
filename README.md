Temporary repo for saving from unsecured/unknown applications!

**NOTE:  It should be obvious, but just in case, DO NOT PLACE sensitive information in this repository!  It is publicly accessible!**

There are applications available on the internet that will allow you to save your data to GitHub directly - but do you trust them to access your NRC GitHub repositories?  Probably not!  This is a repository where you can save such files and review their contents without risking access to sensitive repositories.
